### Data analysis tools for SARS-Cov2/Covid-19 ###

G. Jeschke, April to July 2020

Version 2020/07/12

This version contains only routines required to reproduce figures in "The Wave 2" and to extend this analysis to other countries or later times
More functionality will be added later, as I find time.

End user functions:

mk_figures_200711(fignum) in subdirectory /200711: fignum corresponds to a figure number from 1 to 6 in "The Wave 2"

reload_world_data_covid: reloads current SARS-Cov2/Covid-19 data from EU Open Data and Oxford Blavatnik Government School (inefficient, takes minutes to complete)

All routines are open source, but without license. I do not take any responsibility for bugs or for damage incurred by using them.
